# Not Monopoly Deal: Java Edition

The Java edition of the ever-popular [Not Monopoly Deal](https://github.com/bdngo/not-monopoly-deal).
Emulates the game _Monopoly Deal_ by Hasbro and sold by Cartamundi.

**NOTE: Requires JDK 14 for things like the enhanced switch-case statement.**

## Deviations from the original

- All properties are worth the same amount of cash.
- Properties of the same color are equal (i.e. no names for properties).
- Priority for rent goes money first, then property.
- Giving up 1 property ends the rent.
- Wild cards are treated as normal properties as soon as they are played (i.e. tapping WCs not possible).

## How to Download:

Simply download the `nmd` folder and compile using JDK + JRE 14.
The entry point command is:
```shell script
$ java Main <command> [players/path]
```
where `<command>` can be:
- `start`: Initializes a new game. Must include the number of players.
- `load`: Loads a game from the given file path. By default, the game stores saves in `.games`, created on start.
- `delete`: Deletes a game from the given file path.
